# `update!` is deliberately not exported: ComputePipeline exports it, and that is
# the one a Makie-shaped caller means — `update!(plot; positions = …)` sets an
# attribute. Mantle's writes a buffer now, which is a different verb with the same
# spelling, so it stays `Mantle.update!` and the bare name belongs to Makie's.
